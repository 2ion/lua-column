column.lua
==========

Lua function to columnate strings, similar to the column(1) command.
Given a string with more than one lines (defined as [^\n\r]+), the 1st,
2nd ... nth words of every line will be placed in the 1st, 2nd ... nth
output column respectively. The string resulting from columnation will
be written to stdout or the specfied file handle. Calling column() on a
single-line string equals replacing [%s] with $colsep.

I wrote this as part of a function for pretty-printing tables.

Synopsis
========

    (void) column(string[, file, colsep, blind)

    where

    string  is the input string,
    file    is the output file to be written to (default: io.stdout)
    colsep  is the column separator (default: "    " - 4 spaces)
    blind   is the string substituted for lines with less words than the
            longest line.

Usage
=====

    local column = require("column")
    column(...)

Example
=======

> c([[Dieser Buffer enthält Zeilen mit
> Wörtern ganz ausgesprochen unterschiedlicher Länge, die
> nun in ihre Glieder gesplittet und in
> Spalten ausgegeben werden.]], io.stdout, "    ", "*")

yields

> Dieser      Buffer        enthält          Zeilen               mit           *      *
> Wörtern     ganz          ausgesprochen    unterschiedlicher    Länge,        die    *
> nun         in            ihre             Glieder              gesplittet    und    in    
> Spalten     ausgegeben    werden.          *                    *             *      *

on stdout.

Limitations
===========

Unfortunately, Lua strings/regexes don't handle everything beyond ASCII
not very well, so something may break in these cases (will break in case
of multibyte characters). A workaround for German is already included
([öüäÖÜÄß]), but be warned nevertheless.

Dependencies
============

    * Lua 5.1 or 5.2
